So you actually have to add content. 
You began this on html
the content coincides with the professional branding section which was started in scrivener for the thinkful module
the about sections, mark up for projects etc is being created there and the html will be updated last. The major conversions to html were saved in the index copy.html
almost all content will be cut and pasted instead so as to edit text content without fretting about html formatting or corruption
Updates to relink git hub repos and do their markdowns are also part of the careers branding module so they should allow those links to be fixed. See the feed back on the module and now screen shot on 3/13 1:20pm
