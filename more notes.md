Style Notes
for horizontal list seemingly directly on the li item

nav ul li {
display:inline;
}

for 
flex display 
align-content goes counter to main axis
justify-content is main defined axis
flex-direction defines main axis
these are container level attributes
see css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ 
for the best breakdown of how this all works
